**Diversity & Inclusion**

Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:
no of men
no of women
no of leavers
% employees promoted (FY21)
% of women promoted
% of hires men
% of hires women
% turnover 
Average performance rating: men
Average Performance rating: women

In this HR Diversity and Inclusion analysis project, I developed a Power BI dashboard and created measures to establish key performance indicators (KPIs) for tracking and assessing the organization's diversity initiatives. I analyzed demographic factors such as gender, age, and nationality, using the data to calculate important metrics and gain valuable insights into the organization's diversity and inclusion efforts.
